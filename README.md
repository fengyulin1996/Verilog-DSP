# Verilog-DSP
Complete FIR filterï¼ŒFFT and other DSP function based on Verilog
FPGA is good at finishing Digital Signal Processing for it has a programable structure consist of logic gate, and can do 
parallel operation easily.
I made a place to write down my designing knowledge, and it's also welcome everyone to review.
